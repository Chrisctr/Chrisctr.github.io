About
Mesa’s App Lab is the world’s first digital services hub, 
designed by Scarlet International (a subsidiary of the 
Senex Consortium) for use on the MesaBlock V1 
communication/personal computing device. 
The hub is a collaboration of multiple different 
businesses within the Senex Consortium, who have agreed 
to provide their services to those with the app from 
anywhere in the world. No matter where you are, as long 
as you have signal, you can enlist these businesses to 
help you, whether this be for groceries, travelling or 
even stock broking. In addition, Mesa’s App Lab is 
compatible with the Mesa Medi-Viser, allowing you to 
monitor your health through the device. The service is 
currently in its late alpha stages, so any feedback is 
much appreciated. To submit your feedback, use the panel 
embedded below.
